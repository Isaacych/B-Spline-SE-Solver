# B-Spline-SE-Solver
This suite of codes solve the Schrodinger equation using the pseudo-spectral method with the B-spline functions.
It is currently coded to solve multichannel bounded systems. Algorithm for calculating the continnum state is not yet implemented.
Users can defined their own potential in mod_PEC.f90.
This code is based on the B-spline codes from Jacob Williams. Additional info can be found in mod_bspline.f90 and in https://github.com/jacobwilliams/bspline-fortran.
